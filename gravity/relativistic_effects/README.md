# Relativistic Effects Experiments

Experiments demonstrating relativistic effects emerging from pure LFM substrate dynamics.

## Experiments

| File | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| lfm_time_dilation.py | Gravitational time dilation in chi-wells | H0 REJECTED |
| lfm_frame_dragging.py | Frame dragging from rotating sources | H0 REJECTED |

## Key Results

- **Time Dilation**: Waves in chi-wells oscillate slower (40% reduction at depth)
- **Frame Dragging**: Test waves gain angular momentum in direction of source rotation

## Physics Used

- GOV-01 only for time dilation (dispersion relation)
- GOV-01 + GOV-02 for frame dragging
- NO Schwarzschild metric injected
- NO Lense-Thirring formula used
