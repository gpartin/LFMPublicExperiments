# Gravitational Wave Experiments

Experiments demonstrating gravitational wave phenomena emerging from pure LFM substrate dynamics.

## Experiments

| File | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| lfm_binary_merger.py | Binary black hole inspiral and merger | H REJECTED |
| lfm_neutron_star_merger.py | NS merger with QGP phase (GW170817 comparison) | H REJECTED (4/5 features) |
| lfm_qnm_rigorous.py | Quasi-normal mode ringdown analysis | H REJECTED |

## Key Results

- **Binary Merger**: Inspiral from χ-gradient attraction, merger when sources touch
- **NS Merger**: Chirp, inspiral, ringdown, and QGP phase transition all emerge
- **Ringdown**: QNM oscillations emerge from perturbed χ-wells

## Physics Used

- GOV-01: E/t = cE  χE
- GOV-02: χ/t = cχ  κ(E  E)
- NO post-Newtonian formulas
- NO GR metric injected
