# QGP Phase Transition Experiments

Experiments demonstrating quark-gluon plasma phase transitions from LFM dynamics.

## Experiments

| File | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| lfm_qgp_phase_transition.py | Basic QGP phase transition | In Progress |
| lfm_qgp_refined.py | Refined QGP with density-dependent coupling | In Progress |

## Physics

- Density-dependent kappa (coupling changes at high energy density)
- Phase transition when E^2 exceeds threshold
- Models extreme matter states in neutron star cores
