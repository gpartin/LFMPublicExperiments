# Electromagnetism Experiments

Experiments demonstrating electromagnetic phenomena from LFM phase dynamics.

## Physics

In LFM, electromagnetism emerges from **phase interference**:

- Wave field Ψ = |Ψ|e^(iθ) has phase θ
- **Negative charge**: θ = 0 (electron)
- **Positive charge**: θ = π (positron)

When two waves overlap:
```
|Ψ₁ + Ψ₂|² = |Ψ₁|² + |Ψ₂|² + 2·Re(Ψ₁*·Ψ₂)
```

The cross-term depends on relative phase:
- **Same phase (Δθ = 0)**: Constructive → More E² → REPEL
- **Opposite phase (Δθ = π)**: Destructive → Less E² → ATTRACT

This IS the Coulomb force, emerging from wave interference.

## Experiments

Demonstrates like charges repel, opposite charges attract from phase interference.

Electromagnetic wave propagation in χ-medium.

## The Fine Structure Constant

From χ₀ = 19:
```
α = (χ₀ - 8) / (480π) = 11 / (480π) = 1/137.088
```

Measured: α = 1/137.036

Error: 0.04%
